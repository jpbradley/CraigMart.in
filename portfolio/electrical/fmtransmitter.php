	For this project, my team member and I had to design and create an electrical circuit. 
	We decided to go with a FM Transmitter that used a variable capacitor. 
	This project was for an Engineering class in Spring 2009.
	The picture below is the end product. We were able to connect an iPod to our circuit and 
	broadcast the song over the air to a radio.

	<h3>Goal</h3>
	<p>
	The main goal of the project as stated before was the construct a working FM Transmitter 
	that is able to broadcast within the range of 88MHz and 109MHz. A secondary goal was to have the 
	FM Transmitter broadcast up to 25ft. Through the FM Transmitter, we were hoping to use either a 
	microphone or an iPod to broadcast over the air. Unfortunately, the microphone that we did have was 
	cheap and broke too easily so we had to use an iPod only.

	<h3>Explanation</h3>
	<p>
	Unfortunately, our circuit schematic has long gone and vanished. The dog probably ate it... 
	To explain the circuit with words, we used a tank circuit which is a variable capacitor and inductor 
	in parallel. This is what broadcasts the sound at a certain frequency. By changing the capacitance, 
	the tank circuit will resonate at a different frequency. The circuit we constructed was extremely 
	sensitive as the capacitor&#39;s range was too wide. One small twitch and you would lose the sound 
	on the radio. We noticed that for our circuit, since it was so poorly constructed, could only play on 
	the radio when the station was only static. If a station already was already a radio station, then we would 
	never have any luck.
	When we first started out with just a tank circuit, we could barely hear anything, so to make things 
	better, we added an amplifier to the circuit. Our final circuit was pretty much an amplifier connected to 
	our tank circuit with a poorly made antenna.

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
	We were actually able to broadcast sound to the radio, but like I previously said, it would only work on 
	stations that were pure static. We had to make sure there was no noise around otherwise our circuit would not 
	work. Our circuit usually had to be fairly close to the radio to actually hear anything. Compared to our goals, 
	we were able to play sound to a radio in the frequencies we were expecting. Unfortunately, that was all we were 
	able to do. For our very first circuit I think we accomplished a lot.
