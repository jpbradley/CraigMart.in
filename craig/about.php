		Craig Martin is a recent graduate where he earned a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering 
		with two minors in Computer Science and Physics.<br/>
		Growing up, he always loved to tinker with things and learn how stuff worked. That passion is still 
		with him and is the reason why he pursued an Engineering degree.<br/><br/>
		Now, he enjoys creating projects for himself while he is not at work using the knowledge that he has 
		gained from school. His projects mainly focus on either software or firmware. For example, building this 
		website or making a line following robot.<br/><br/>
		Additionally, creating these projects is a great way for him to learn on his own. It allows him to be 
		challenged and introduced to new and better things. Even though he may be re-inventing the wheel with 
		his projects, he believes that it is important to try things on his own so he has a deeper understanding of 
		basic concepts that will enable him to apply the concepts to a new idea.
