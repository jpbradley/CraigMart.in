						Welcome to my brand new domain! <br/>
						My old website was built on top of Drupal and unfortunately, my web host is too slow. Drupal is overkill for a personal portfolio, 
						so I will be building a simple website.
						<br/><br/>
						For this website, I am going back to the basics and will use HTML5/CSS3. 
						I am trying to design this website to look like a desktop, however I am terrible at designing.
						Eventually I will add a lot of functionality through PHP/Javascript to make this website pop 
						and hide the fact that this website doesn't look elegant.
						<br/><br/>
						Maybe I'll work on how the website looks too... I just need to find some time or extend the day!
						<br/> So far I have been able to get the basic website design completed. There are a few touch ups
						that I need to keep doing, but I figured this was a good starting place.
						<br/><br/>
						If you find any issues or have suggestions about the website please feel free to <a href="mailto:admin@craigmart.in">email</a> me
						or go to my <a href="https://github.com/DirtyRasa/CraigMart.in/issues" target="_blank">Github</a> and log an issue/enhancement.
